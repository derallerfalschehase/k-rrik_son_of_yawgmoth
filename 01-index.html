      <h3>Castaway</h3>
      <p>
        He crashed on the Tolarian beach with his ship, and was found and
        rescued by a young Jhoira. Jhoira was fond of contemplating the ocean
        and thinking of Shiv. She longed for a strong man like the ones in her
        tribe of Ghitu. Kerrick was not like the immature boys who roamed the
        Academy's walls (like Teferi, the magical prodigy who had a crush on
        Jhoira). Jhoira built a small house on the beach for herself and
        Kerrick. She was unaware that he was a Phyrexian sleeper agent. At night
        she would sneak from the academy to visit her secret guest, her secret
        lover.
      </p>

      <h3>Saboteur</h3>
      <p>
        One night, Karn, the silver golem, and also Jhoira's only true friend,
        was wandering about the beach while having been sent back in time a few
        hours in one of Urza's (here known as Master Malzra) time-traveling
        experiments. Karn discovered Kerrick and Jhoira but promised to tell no
        one about them. On another such voyage to the near past, Karn discovered
        Kerrick stealing blueprints from Urza's lab, and so he followed him,
        taking advantage of the fact that he was unphased with this "past" world
        (a side effect of the time machine). Karn followed Kerrick through the
        secret passage that Jhoira used to sneak out of the Academy. Kerrick
        unknowingly led Karn into a secret Phyrexian meeting in the woods, where
        Karn overheard the Phyrexian's plans of invading the Academy. When Karn
        returned to the present, he quickly attempted to warn Urza, but it was
        too late, for the attack was already upon them. Kerrick had brought
        Phyrexian negators into the Academy. The negators began slaughtering
        students and teachers alike. Karn fought his way to Jhoira's room, where
        he found her body covered in blood on the ground. Karn then fought and
        slew Jhoira's killer, a negator. After killing the negator, Karn
        returned to Urza and suggested using the time machine to prevent the
        attack. Urza agreed and sent Karn back in time once more, even though
        the time machine was near an overload. Karn was successful in catching
        the past Kerrick, even breaking his leg in the process. However, Karn
        was suddenly and forcefully pulled into the present. The time machine
        had overloaded and malfunctioned. The time machine was casting arcing
        rays of temporal energy and was instantly aging parts of the lab into
        dust. Then the machine exploded and caused the great temporal disaster
        in Tolaria. Urza, using his planeswalker powers, quickly petrified the
        students and staff closest to him (14 total, including Barrin) and
        planeswalked away to safety.
      </p>
      <h3>Lord of the fortress</h3>
      <p>
        Urza, after returning 10 years later, found that Kerrick, the sleeper
        agent, had survived the anomaly. Kerrick, along with other phyrexians,
        was trapped in a fast-time rift. Kerrick had constructed an enormous
        Phyrexian fortress and army in this fast-time rift. Kerrick renamed
        himself K'rrik and became the lord of that fortress. From inside this
        rift, he grew his army and devised ways to attack Urza and his team, who
        were rebuilding the Academy.
      </p>
      <h3>K'rrik's fate</h3>
      <p>
        While Urza was imprisoned in Yavimaya by Multani, Barrin's forces were
        finally overrun. After he sent a beacon to Urza calling for aid, Urza
        shook off his stupor. Multani attempted to recapture him but instead was
        stuck within his energy as Urza planeswalked away, first to Shiv to
        gather warriors and then to Tolaria to fight. In the battle, Multani
        observed that Urza protected all the life in Tolaria from the
        Phyrexians. Understanding the true danger that was K’rrik, Urza
        descended into the fast time chasm and saw the horrors of Phyrexia.
        K’rrik disabled Urza but Multani lent Urza his strength and together
        they were able to kill the Phyrexian. Multani animated Tolaria's forests
        and the remaining negators were destroyed as well.
