      <p>
        Phyrexia (/faɪˈrɛksɨa/ fy-REX-ia)[2] is an artificial plane of
        mechanical and biomechanical "life", an ecosystem comprised of metal,
        death, and tissue. A hellish world with an accelerated evolution of
        artifact creatures. It is also known as the Machine Hell and the Nine
        Hells.[3]
      </p>
      <h2 id="history-id">History of Phyrexia</h2>
      <h3>Creation</h3>
      <p>
        As a yet unnamed plane, Phyrexia was created by an ancient evil
        planeswalker.[4] Little is known of him, aside from the fact that he was
        a humanoid that preferred to assume the form of a dragon: he died just a
        month before Yawgmoth was transported to Phyrexia. According to the
        planeswalker Dyfed, the original size of Phyrexia was two or three times
        that of the Thran Empire.[5] Prior to Yawgmoth, Phyrexia already had
        most of its spheres, the first one bearing a paradisical, sunlit
        simulacrum of forests and plains with "serpents" coiled around the
        trunks of the "trees", while the second sphere was illuminated by a
        metallic sheen and bearing crude artifact creatures with amalgamous
        features, from which the "serpents" evolved. According to Dyfed the meat
        of these creatures was edible.[5]
      </p>
      <h3>Yawgmoth's refuge</h3>
      <p>
        Phyrexia was not so different from Mirrodin until Yawgmoth arrived
        thousands of years ago, brought there by the planeswalker Dyfed. Rebbec
        constructed a new infirmary on this new plane. 9000 years later this
        infirmary would become Gamalgoth, the first city of Phyrexia. Yawgmoth,
        with the remnants and descendants of the phthisis-inflicted Thran
        humans, whom he saved through the process he referred to as "Phyresis"
        (essentially the replacement of weak mortality with artifice) and from
        which he named the plane, came here when they were forced out of the
        Thran Empire as traitors. The ensuing war destroyed the nation of the
        Thran. Yawgmoth gave Phyrexian organisms a purpose: to thrive, to grow
        beyond the confines of Phyrexia and into the rest of the Multiverse.
        Over hundreds of years, Phyrexia evolved priests and acolytes who
        extolled and worshiped Yawgmoth, as well as demons and abominations of
        infinite variety to kill for him. Witch Engines, Birth Priests, Flesh
        Reavers, Hollow Dogs,[6] Blood Praetors. Over time a vast social order
        emerged, a horrifying food chain with church-like rites and rituals.
        Phyrexian organisms were judged by their ability to survive their
        nightmarish world. Successful ones were “evolved” with an unspeakable
        mixture of necrotic tissue and greasy metal. Eventually, Phyrexia
        created great Spore Engines and Plague Dreadnoughts – unimaginably huge,
        quasi-living artifact machines designed for war.
      </p>
      <h3>Plotting Dominaria's downfall</h3>
      <p>
        The Phyrexians' main purpose after their entrapment in the plane was to
        invade and destroy their old home of Dominaria. Many years were spent
        preparing for this invasion, with various plans, weapons, and soldiers
        being created throughout the ages.[7] Also aware that their artificial
        home plane would collapse after some time, the survival of the Phyrexian
        way depended upon the successful entrance into Dominaria and the defeat
        of its life forms. However, this transfer was made impossible for five
        millennia because of the closing of the portal between Dominaria and
        Phyrexia in the Caves of Koilos, where the planeswalker Glacian
        transfused his being into two halves of a powerstone that was used by
        his wife, Rebbec, to seal off the connection. During this time, the
        Phyrexians waited, plotted, and built up their forces for the time when
        their way would be clear into the old world.
      </p>
      <h3>The Brothers' War</h3>
      <p>
        After some five thousand years had passed, the nation of Argive was
        founded, and the brothers Urza and Mishra were born. The two were sent
        off to a camp to study artifice with the archaeologist, Tocasia, after
        some time. During an outing to survey a new dig site, the two brothers
        found the powerstone on a pedestal in a cave, and inadvertently opened
        the portal to Phyrexia when they took the stone and it split again into
        its two halves. This event would ultimately be the undoing of Dominaria.
        Seeing his opportunity, Yawgmoth sent through the Phyrexian demon, Gix,
        to scout. Eventually, the Brothers' rivalry developed into the Brothers'
        War, and Mishra eventually made contact with the Phyrexians. Gix had
        built up a religious following of machine worshippers, and he used his
        influence to manipulate the two sides. He offered aid and Phyrexian
        equipment to Mishra, even compleating him. The plans to defeat Urza were
        foiled when he activated the Golgothian Sylex, obliterating Argoth, the
        site of the war's final battle. After the time of this blast, the Shard
        of the Twelve Worlds was formed, and the Phyrexians were once again
        unable to travel to Dominaria.
      </p>
      <h3>The return of Gix</h3>
      <p>
        For some time, Phyrexia was again forced to wait until it could resume
        its attack. It had also unknowingly encountered its greatest enemy,
        Urza, who had ascended to become a planeswalker. He had become obsessed
        with the destruction of those he blamed for his brother's sickening
        transformation. However, Urza was also locked out of Dominaria for a
        time and spent his next years wandering the planes. On one of his
        travels, he met Xantcha, a Phyrexian sleeper agent that had gone rogue
        and had been exiled from her home plane. The two were chased for a long
        time through the Multiverse by Phyrexians, who moved by way of Phyrexian
        Portals. After a time the two returned to Terisiare, at the end of the
        Ice Age, when Freyalise cast the World Spell and shattered the Shard.
        Not long thereafter, Gix returned to Dominaria and created another
        secretive cult. Phyrexians had also begun moving into Dominaria through
        new portals. Urza learned of Gix through Xantcha and traveled to Koilos
        to meet and battle him, with his allies, Xantcha and Ratepe. A final
        battle between Urza and Gix broke out in the ancient caves, and Urza
        defeated the Phyrexian demon with the help of his friends. However, to
        do this, both Xantcha and Ratepe were killed. Urza then proceeded to
        build up global responses to the threat of Phyrexia.
      </p>
      <h3>Rath</h3>
      <p>
        The Phyrexians began another plot to gain them re-entrance. Yawgmoth
        ordered the construction of the artificial plane of Rath, through the
        use of a newly created substance called flowstone. A giant refinery was
        constructed in the center of a pocket universe attached to Dominaria, so
        well-hidden that no planeswalker would find it. The flowstone helped the
        Phyrexians to construct an artificial world for use as a staging point
        for their troops. Eventually, the mass of this plane would grow beyond
        its own ability to contain, and Rath would overlay onto Dominaria. The
        violent dimensional barriers of the plane caused creatures and things
        from other planes to be pulled in, and peoples from Dominaria came to
        populate Rath along with forests and other creatures, as well. To rule
        Rath, an evincar was elected. The first known evincar was a man named
        Davvol, but the most famous of their number was the mighty Volrath,
        onetime blood-brother of Gerrard.
      </p>
      <h3>Invasion</h3>
      <p>
        Later on, the Phyrexians were finally prepared for their climactic siege
        of Dominaria. Portal ships,[8] large flying machines with expansive
        Phyrexian portal technology attached, made their way into Dominaria from
        the skies of Rath and opened up an entrance for the Phyrexian war
        fleets. The ships entered Dominaria over the sky of Benalia, the first
        target of the invasion led by the Phyrexian general Tsabo Tavoc. Later,
        Tsabo led battles at Koilos and Yavimaya, losing those to Coalition
        forces after days of bloody strife. Tolaria was overtaken by Phyrexians
        and wiped out by the self-destructive wizard Barrin with his most
        powerful spell. New Argive was besieged and crushed, and the Burning
        Isles were overtaken, Steel entirely filled with Phyrexian troops and
        Urborg secured. The Phyrexians' plans in the oceans, however, were
        stymied by the merfolk of Etlan Shiis. With the destruction of the
        portals, the first wave of the invasion was finished. Tsabo Tavoc had
        been beaten and badly wounded by Gerrard and Karn, and retreated back to
        Phyrexia. There was time for only a brief repast, then the invasion
        resumed. The Rathi Overlay signaled the beginning of the second wave of
        the Phyrexian armies. As Rath placed itself on the surface of Dominaria,
        battles broke out all across the planet as Coalition forces intercepted
        more invaders. Meanwhile, Tsabo Tavoc was punished for her failures and
        repaired with under-grade scrap parts, ultimately being eaten by Crovax.
      </p>
      <h3>Counter attack and betrayal</h3>
      <p>
        Phyrexia received its own share of devastation when Urza assembled the
        collection of planeswalkers he called the Nine Titans and armed them
        with massive suits of power armor known as titan engines, planning a
        counter-attack on the Nine Hells. Once inside the plane, the
        planeswalkers unleashed havoc, hoping to destroy the chamber. They were
        interrupted by the betrayal of Tevesh Szat, who killed his fellow
        planeswalker, Daria. Urza had a device implanted in each of the suits, a
        "kill rubrik," which could be tapped into by him, killing the occupant.
        Upon the expected treachery of Tevesh Szat, Urza activated the rubrik
        and killed Szat, sealing him in a Soul bomb, a powerful weapon that used
        the power of the soul inside to cause mass destruction. This would have
        been used to destroy Phyrexia, but Urza was convinced by angel-like
        Phyrexians to kill another of his companions, Taysir, using the same
        method he had on Szat. After this, he was taken to the Seventh Sphere to
        observe what was apparently his brother Mishra at the command of The
        Lord of The Wastes, who had been tortured for thousands of years in the
        hellish place. Next, he went to the Ninth Sphere to worship Yawgmoth
        himself, along with Gerrard.
      </p>
      <h3>Urza vs. Gerrard</h3>
      <p>
        The pair were forced to fight each other to the death. Yawgmoth stripped
        Urza of his planeswalker powers, leaving him a mere man. Gerrard had
        chosen to serve Yawgmoth in the hopes that the dark god could give him
        back his slain love, Hanna, while Urza had slowly become affectionate of
        his foes, admiring them as powerful beings even while fighting them for
        ages past, being promised by Yawgmoth himself that he would have
        unfathomable knowledge if he bested Gerrard. The fight that followed
        lasted for quite a while until Gerrard managed to land a strike that
        beheaded Urza.
      </p>
      <h3>Yawgmoth vs. The Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        It was then that Yawgmoth himself returned to Dominaria, for the first
        time in thousands of years. He was a being entirely changed from his
        previous existence on the plane; he appeared now like a cloud of death
        that killed all in its path and brought them back as undead to fight for
        Phyrexia. Yawgmoth himself was the final stage of the invasion. After
        the Weatherlight shot down the Null Moon to release its abundance of
        white mana on the dark god, Yawgmoth attacked the Weatherlight directly.
        It was then that the Legacy Weapon was completed and a fatal burst of
        energy ended the war, finally destroying the Lord of the Wastes himself.
        Phyrexian forces lost all will to live with the death of their god.
        Phyrexia had been defeated.
      </p>
      <h3>Aftermath</h3>
      <p>
        The plane of Phyrexia is nothing but a smoldering shell now. It was left
        in shambles after the Nine Titans launched their offensive, but whether
        or not any Phyrexians survived and stayed back is unknown. Approximately
        a century later, when Karona the False God was birthed, she traveled the
        multiverse through magical portals, seeking a plane for each color of
        mana. She was said to have met a variety of individuals from Serra to
        Teferi, and when she came in contact with a plane of black mana, it was
        revealed to be Phyrexia. Yawgmoth, appearing as a gigantic spirit, was
        said to be sleeping under a volcano in the ruined place. Later, however,
        the encounter with Teferi was proven false when the planeswalker
        returned to Dominaria, and it is thought that Karona had been
        delusional. Thus apparently Yawgmoth is truly dead, in Lord Windgrace's
        own words; indeed, among Dominarians, Urborg is referred to as the Tomb
        of Yawgmoth. Storywise, Phyrexia itself has not been returned to since
        the invasion.
      </p>
      <h3>Phyrexian resurrection</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, stirrings on the plane of Mirrodin have given rise to a
        recreation of Phyrexia. Karn, Mirrodin's Creator, had accidentally left
        some of his own Phyrexian Oil contagion within the core, that has begun
        to spread, corrupting the golem Memnarch, and currently giving rise to a
        legion of creatures whose goal is to drive the people of the plane to
        Phyresis, giving rise to a New Phyrexia. The five praetors of New
        Phyrexia now control the plane, having defeated the Mirrodin resistance
        and turned it toward beginning a new inter-planar Phyrexian empire.
        Influenced by the Five Suns of Mirrodin, this New Phyrexia now
        encompasses all colors of magic.

      <h2 id="sym-id">the Phyrexian Symbol</h2>
      <p>
        The symbol that represents Phyrexia is a circle-and-vertical-bar,
        reminiscent of the Greek letter phi.[9][10] Masters 25 cards with the
        watermark, the set symbol for New Phyrexia, and the watermark for the
        Phyrexian-allied cards from the Scars of Mirrodin block count as
        "Phyrexian" for cards like Stamp of Approval.[11]

    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="stu-id">Structure of Phyrexia</h2>
      <p>
        The plane consisted of nine nested spheres, each with its own purpose
        and, often, mechanical ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h3>first sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The First Sphere of Phyrexia is a mechanical parody of life. At the time
        of Yawgmoth's arrival it was paradisical, with "serpents" and "strange
        birds" frolicking through sunlit forests. Afterwards, this was twisted
        into an artificial jungle bedewed by oily rain. Streams of oil also run
        through the first sphere's landscape. It is home to a few forms of
        dragon engines and many other mechanical animals simulating true life.
        Rusting artifact debris lay around long plains filled with metallic dust
        and soot. Huge furnaces spew ash into the air. Newts are brought to this
        Sphere, likely for the purpose of selecting those worthy for
        compleation. The first sphere has a sky described as red, sunless, and
        laden with gray clouds.
      </p>
      <h3>second sphere</h3>
      <p>
        Scraps and ruins from the first sphere are contained in the Second
        Sphere. Metal beams, pipes, and other structures make up the roof.
        Smokestacks from lower levels also appear in this level of Phyrexia.
        These are all that offer any source of light. Gargantuan ammunition
        dumps as large as entire communities are located here.
      </p>
      <h3>third sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Third Sphere is filled with metal pipes, which create space
        distortions that prevent planeswalking to lower spheres. Horrors of
        Phyrexia stalk this place.
      </p>
      <h3>fourth sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Fourth Sphere is where the bulk of Phyrexia's population exists.[12]
        Here are more smokestacks, as well as the vat facilities where newts are
        grown and compleated. Vat priests work here, monitoring the Phyrexian
        newborns and performing the operations of transforming them into
        Phyrexian machines and warriors. Phyrexian warriors are trained in this
        place as well. The fourth sphere has clouds and lightning and, during
        the flashes, the pipes of the third sphere can be seen. Phyrexian planar
        portals, reinvented versions of old Thran portals, were built here and
        opened to new planes that would be conquered for Yawgmoth. They were
        opened only through sacrificing artifacts or the use of a great amount
        of energy.
      </p>
      <h3>fifth sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Fifth Sphere, called the Boiling Sea, is an ocean of glistening oil
        used by Vat Priests of Fourth to breed newts. Massive steam creatures
        also live here.
      </p>
      <h3>sixth sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Phyrexian Inner Circle is housed in the Sixth Sphere. It is a realm
        for the Phyrexian governmental body; here are the most prestigious of
        Yawgmoth's servants, such as demons,[13] the Praetors, and other
        officials. The sixth sphere has waving fields of barbed wire "grass" and
        the sky is solid white, seemingly resembling plains. It is here where
        pneumagogs are both spirit and flesh.
      </p>
      <h3>seventh sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Seventh Sphere of Phyrexia is an eternal furnace of flames used both
        to power the plane and punish those who have failed Yawgmoth. Gix is the
        only Phyrexian known to have survived the Seventh Sphere. It is a
        hellish place known as the "Punishment Sphere." Prisoners, artificers,
        and failures of any sort are brought here for torture. Gremlins live on
        this Sphere. A sky of enormous grinders is studded with diamond teeth,
        gnashing against each other, which spatial distortions causing their
        distance from the ground to vary.
      </p>
      <h3>eigthsphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Eighth Sphere is a place of pure energy. Little else is known of it.
      </p>
      <h3>ninth sphere</h3>
      <p>
        The Ninth Sphere is the control center for all of Phyrexia. Up until the
        Invasion, it was where Yawgmoth resided, plotting his eventual takeover
        of Dominaria. Yawgmoth also stayed here, dormant within his sanctum for
        some time, while his minions acted in his will and saw to it that his
        plans were executed.
      </p>
      <img src="./Phyrexia.webp" alt="spheres" class="pic">
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="li-id">Phyrexian life forms</h2>
      <p>
        Phyrexians can appear in many forms. They can often be recognized by
        features like dripping ichor, eyelessness, cysts, pustules, or the
        expulsion of noxious gases.[14] . With possible exception of the
        pneumagogs, all are aligned with black mana, and with the exception of
        the gremlins they are naturally all phyrexian.
      </p>
      <h3>newts</h3>
      <p>
        The first stage of any Phyrexian's life is that of the Newt. These
        creatures are grown in vats of glistening oil and appear as androgynous,
        hairless humans. They are grown to adulthood then prepared and released
        for life in the dark plane. Newts are later put through a process called
        compleation. At this point, they are transformed into other forms of
        Phyrexians to serve any of a number of purposes for Yawgmoth.
      </p>
      <h3>sleeper agents</h3>
      <p>
        Sleeper agents are fully grown and sometimes genetically modified newts
        who have not been compleated, appearing as regular human beings, sent to
        spy on other planes and perform clandestine operations outside of
        Phyrexia. Some are completely unaware of their status and task, simply
        dropped off on other planes to be used as hidden cameras.
      </p>
      <h3>cults</h3>
      <p>
        Yawgmoth and the Phyrexians have active cults around the planes, mainly
        in Dominaria, who worshiped machines and the power of artifice. The Cult
        of Gix was one such example, which existed for the later duration of the
        Brothers' War. Those who participated in the cult would augment
        themselves with metal, embedding it in their skin in all sorts of ways,
        as a sign of their willingness to become machine from the flesh. Gix
        orchestrated the Cult from its center and even gave Phyrexian technology
        and instruction to his worshipers. Similar cults were active on various
        planes and areas at different times up until the Phyrexian Invasion.
      </p>
      <h3>gremlins</h3>
      <p>
        Among the lowliest of lifeforms, the Gremlins are small, bat-eared
        creatures (apparently related to ouphes on other worlds) that torment
        artificers and pull apart unwanted artifacts. They also serve as menial
        labor.
      </p>
      <h3>minions</h3>
      <p>
        These are the agents and specialized creations of Yawgmoth, created as
        versatile instruments in his mad war against all biological life.
        Minions serve a number of purposes, such as assassins, spies, or shock
        troops. Minions include the Infiltrator, the Slayer, and the Broodlings.
      </p>
      <h3>undead</h3>
      <p>
        Phyrexia employs zombies, skeletons, and other forms of walking dead in
        its fight against the Multiverse. Some are made to function through the
        adding of artificial improvements. The Monitor, Unworthy Dead, Reaper,
        Scuta[15], and the Bloodstock are examples of undead in Phyrexia's
        ranks. Some of them are noxious and harmful to life even through touch.
        It is also notable that some of the Phyrexians printed as zombies were
        intended to be minions, but were changed to zombies for set design
        reasons.
      </p>
      <h3>carriers</h3>
      <p>
        Biomechanical constructs used to spread Phyrexian-engineered plagues.
        They can all be utilized as suicide strikers, destroying themselves to
        release their pathogenic load upon the battlefield. These include the
        Denouncer, Debaser, Defiler, and Plaguelord.
      </p>
      <h3>mechanical constructs</h3>
      <p>
        Phyrexian inhabitants and creations usually involve mechanical parts and
        additions, but some are entirely mechanical in nature. These are the
        massive devices and war machines used to wipe out any resistance left
        after the initial wave of primary combat troops and the release of the
        plagues. The Dragon Engines, War Beasts, Hulks, and Colossi all fall
        under this category. The largest and most brutal of Yawgmoth's
        monstrosities is the Phyrexian Dreadnought, another totally mechanical
        part of the arsenal.
      </p>
      <h3>horrors</h3>
      <p>
        Horrors are frightening monstrosities, sometimes combinations of
        creatures listed above. Many of them are free-willed and may live apart
        from the other Phyrexians, not taking part in the efforts of the rest of
        the plane. They can be dangerous to even their peers. The Rager, Witch
        Engine, Plague Spitter, Devouring Strossus, Gargantua, and Negator are
        all Horrors.
      </p>
      <h3>knights</h3>
      <p>
        The most elite of warriors, those that are more intelligent and capable
        than mere killing devices, are the Knights. They have their human mental
        attributes, such as free will, but still remain under the command of
        Yawgmoth. Phyrexian Knights are composed of a few different Orders: the
        Eastern Paladins, dedicated to eradicating all-natural life; the Western
        Paladins, avid destroyers of all societies that are not of Phyrexia; and
        the Order of Yawgmoth, the prestigious guard of the Ineffable himself.
        (There also seem to have been human knightly orders known as the Eastern
        and Western Paladins on Dominaria that are not connected to Phyrexia.)
        The Sanguine Guard is another of the knightly orders, though its
        function is unclear.
      </p>
      <h3>demons</h3>
      <p>
        The most powerful and loyal servants of Phyrexia were the Demons, beings
        of immeasurable evil. These terrible entities made up the greater part
        of Yawgmoth's Inner Circle and included the Ineffable's most trusted
        minion, Gix. Other, lesser Phyrexian demons existed as well, fleshy,
        mindless things whose only purpose was to scour other worlds for
        resources to be used on Phyrexia.
      </p>
      <h3>pneumagogs</h3>
      <p>
        Described as insectile creatures with six wings and red shells, these
        creatures are purely physical on the upper spheres and purely spiritual
        on the lower spheres, but exist as both on the sixth sphere.[16] Their
        beauty convinced Urza to turn to the Phyrexian cause.[17]
      </p>

    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="mi-id">militarization</h2>
      <p>
        The plane of Phyrexia had many weapons at its disposal. Aside from the
        Phyrexians themselves, there were artifacts, biohazardous spores and
        plagues, and mutational organic implements such as venom sacs. Typical
        Phyrexian soldiers made use of nasty blades and saws, though they often
        were equipped with plenty of claws, fangs, and brute force. Many had
        venomous fangs implanted in their faces, and others had poisonous
        stingers. They were stronger and more resilient to pain than the average
        human being. Power armor, improved upon for centuries from the original
        suits of the Halcyon Guard, was almost always fitted onto Phyrexians in
        various ways and appearances, possibly fueled by Phyrexian powerstones.
        Some Phyrexians had firearms, such as those used by the nightstalkers of
        Caliman, or the armament of the Reaper. These may have been beam
        weapons, like the ray cannons used in the flying ships of the
        Thran-Phyrexian War, or perhaps fired projectiles of some sort.
        Phyrexians that were entirely compleated were mainly metallic, some of
        which took entirely different shapes than the newt, becoming huge
        behemoths of steel, wire, and gears. The Gargantua is one example, using
        its sheer size to outmatch any opponents it would meet on the
        battlefield. Its huge claws were large enough to fit as much material
        and debris as an earthmover and were capable of crushing down virtually
        anything in that space. Mechanical devices were one of the potent forces
        in Phyrexia's armies. Many of Phyrexia's constructs were semi-magical,
        while others were complex combinations of purely mechanical processes.
        One of Phyrexia's greatest weapons was the engineered plague.
        Nano-technologically improved spores took out entire populations on
        Dominaria, these plagues were a major threat during the invasion. They
        were unleashed by Phyrexian carriers, such as the Plaguelord and the
        Defiler. There were different pathogens created by Phyrexia, but a few
        may have also been contained or enhanced specimens of the phthisis that
        inflicted the Thran before their fall. Some plagues were tested on
        Dominaria around the time of Urza's adventures, as well. These were part
        of an odd concoction, as described in Phyrexian progress notes;
        according to the text of other carriers, the disease is described which
        causes rashes, nausea, fever, cough, muscle aches, then delirium,
        convulsions, and death. This may have been a generic plague outbreak.
        It's been noted that glistening oil was to be used as a weapon late in
        the invasion, possibly after Yawgmoth's entrance into Dominaria, for
        reasons that have been lost to time. Hundreds of year later, some of the
        substance ended up on the artificial plane of Mirrodin through Xantha's
        heartstone, embedded in Karn, Mirrodin's creator, corrupting its
        guardian Memnarch and setting off that plane's own age of troubles.

    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="re-id">religion</h2>
      <p>Phyrexian religion is largely based upon the "religious" adherence to their scriptures and perspective. They believe that mortal flesh is a sin, imperfect, and prone to weakness and decay. They worship the perfection of machines; however, only those made by Yawgmoth and his order of priests are considered sacred. Artifacts made by mortal, natural hands are considered as abominations, unfit for Phyrexia, and not birthed for its cause. Even more despised are the artificers themselves, making a sacrilegious imitation of the work the Father of Machines has done. The Grand Evolution, the search for evolutionary superiority and improvement, and the process of phyresis, Yawgmoth's words denoting his battle against disease, death, and weakness, are objectives on which the Phyrexians focus themselves devoutly.

        Much of the beliefs of the Phyrexians, if they can be called beliefs, are explained in their hallowed writings, the Phyrexian Scriptures. Here are a few excerpts:
        
        "Let weak feed upon weak, that we may divine the nature of strength"
        
        "From void evolved Phyrexia. Great Yawgmoth, Father of Machines, saw its perfection. Thus the Grand Evolution began."
        
        "Ash is our air, darkness our flesh."
        
        "Father of Machines! Your filigree gaze carves us, and the scars dance upon our grateful flesh."
        
        "Great Yawgmoth moves across the seas of shard and bone and rust. We exalt him in life, in death, and in between."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="ph-id">philosophy</h2>
      <p>Phyrexia has at its core a very gritty and mentally enticing philosophy. The ideas themselves are collectively called 'Phyresis', a phrase coined by Yawgmoth himself. This system is largely based upon the will to survive and the concept of controlled evolution. The key idea of the Phyrexians is comparable to social Darwinism; evolution by removal of all the foes of the favorable species, the Phyrexians. This is applied socially, by way of eugenics.

        Yawgmoth acts as the director of this process. Eliminating all foes and striving for efficiency, no matter the cost is the goal of Phyrexia. This plan is, without a doubt, very effective; however, it is sentimentally hollow and void of 'human' characteristics. Yawgmoth and his Grand Evolution are without art, emotion, morals, and personal thought or freedom. In this, Phyrexia is the polar opposite of Dominaria, with its virtues and culture.
